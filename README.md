# RPG - Command Line Role Playing Game

This **RPG** project is a command line role playing game developed in C, aiming to provide an immersive RPG experience in a text-based environment. It is an educational project to explore the concepts of C programming, while addressing essential features of role playing games such as combat, inventory management, and character progression.

## Features

- **Character Creation**: Customize your hero with unique characteristics.
- **Turn-Based Combat**: Face enemies in a turn-based combat system, with attack, defense, and item options.
- **Inventory Management**: Collect items and manage your inventory to improve your skills and equipment.
- **World Exploration**: Explore an imaginary world and discover quests and enemies.
- **Progression and Levels**: Evolve your character by gaining experience and increasing your skills.

1. Master the basics of C programming by working on a challenging project.

2. Apply concepts of memory management, complex data structures, and file management.

3. Discover the logic behind role-playing games and turn-based combat systems.

4. Experiment with object-oriented programming in C by structuring the code around characters and objects.

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of the C language.
- Familiarity with data structures (arrays, structures).
- A C compiler (like GCC) to compile and run the game.
